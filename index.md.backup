# Chen Dan 丹晨 

 I am a final year Ph.D. student at [Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Pradeep Ravikumar][Pradeep Ravikumar] (previously also co-advised by  [Avrim Blum][Avrim Blum]). Prior to this, I received B.Sc from [School of EECS, Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm), where I worked with [Liwei Wang][Liwei Wang]. 
 
[CV (last updated:  May 2021)](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

My research interest is in the broad area of robust statistical learning, with an emphasis on the theoretical understanding and practical algorithms for learning under various types of adversarial distribution shift. This encompasses many new challenges in ML, including:

- Adversarial Examples: See e.g. my papers in [ICML'20a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16384) and [ICLR'20](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJx1Na4Fwr);
- Class/Group Imbalance: [ICML'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06142) and [ICML'20b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12914);
- Outliers in Data: [ICML'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06142).
