# Chen Dan 丹晨 

 I am a 5th year Ph.D. student at [Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Pradeep Ravikumar][Pradeep Ravikumar] (previously also co-advised by  [Avrim Blum][Avrim Blum]). Prior to this, I received B.Sc from [School of EECS, Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm), where I worked with [Liwei Wang][Liwei Wang]. My research interest is in the theoretical aspect of machine learning and algorithm design.

I visited [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/) in summer 2018, hosted by [Avrim Blum][Avrim Blum].
