# Dr. Chen Dan 丹晨 

I am a postdoctral researcher at [TTIC][TTIC] working with Prof. [Avrim Blum][Avrim Blum]. In 2022, I graduated with Ph.D. degree from [Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Pradeep Ravikumar][Pradeep Ravikumar]. Prior to this, I received B.Sc from [School of EECS, Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm), where I worked with [Liwei Wang][Liwei Wang]. 

**I am looking for research positions in the industry.**

[CV (last updated: Jan 2023)](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

My research interest is in the broad area of robust statistical learning, with an emphasis on the theoretical understanding and practical algorithms for learning under various types of adversarial distribution shift. This encompasses many new challenges in ML, including:

- Adversarial Examples: See e.g. my papers in [ICML'20a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16384) and [ICLR'20](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJx1Na4Fwr);
- Class/Group Imbalance: [ICML'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06142) and [ICML'20b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12914);
- Outliers in Data: [ICML'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06142).
