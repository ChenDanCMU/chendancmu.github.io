I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at [Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/) (previously, also co-advised by  [Prof. Avrim Blum](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/)). Prior to this, I received B.Sc from Department of Machine Intelligence, [School of EECS, Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm), where I worked with [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/index.htm). My research interest is in the theoretical aspect of machine learning and algorithm design.

I visited [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/) in summer 2018, hosted by [Prof. Avrim Blum](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/).

My CV can be found [here](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/CV.pdf) (last update: June 2020).
