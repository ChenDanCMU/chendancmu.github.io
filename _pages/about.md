I am a third year Ph.D. student at [Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/). Prior to this, I received B.Sc from Peking University, where I worked with [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/index.htm). My research interest is in learning theory and approximation algorithms.

I visited [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](http://www.ttic.edu/) in summer 2018, working with [Prof. Avrim Blum](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/).
