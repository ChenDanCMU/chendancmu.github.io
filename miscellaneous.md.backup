#  Miscellaneous
- My hometown is [Shanghai, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai). 

- My favourite color scheme is [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/).

- My [Erdős number](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/chen-dan-0001/paul-erdos) is 3 (via Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen - Laszlo Babai - Paul Erdős; or via Avrim Blum - Joel Spencer - Paul Erdős).

- Besides academics, I am an amateur runner and chess player. My [lichess](https://lichess.org/) blitz rating is around 2000 (top ~10% among all players). My profile photo was taken after I finished my first half marathon in Pittsburgh, May 2018.  

- I have been very successful in fighting with obesity. In 2017, my body weight dropped from [100kg](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/photos/100.jpeg) to [69kg](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/photos/69.jpeg) in 6 months: [before](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/photos/before.jpeg),  [after](https://chendancmu.github.io/files/photos/after.jpeg).

- [Here](https://www.zhihu.com/question/49249958/answer/115964465) is a story (in Chinese) about how I independently re-discovered *Poncelet's Theorem* [[1]](http://user.math.uzh.ch/halbeisen/publications/pdf/poncelet.pdf) [[2]](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PonceletsPorism.html) in 2011 as a high-schooler. It is among the top-voted answers in the maths category of zhihu.com (Chinese version of Quora).

- I am maintaining a [collection](https://chendancmu.github.io/checklist.html) of extended reading material for [Checklists for Stat-ML PhD students](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/checklists.html) by Aaditya Ramdas, which I personally find really helpful.
